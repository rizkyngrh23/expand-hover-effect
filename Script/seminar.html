                        Seminar, the student council of Millennium Science School, oversees clubs and allocates budgets based on project practicality. In Vol. 2, the Game Development Department 
                        infiltrates Seminar to recover Veritas' Optimus Mirror System. Later, Koyuki betrays Seminar by stealing funds for gambling but is caught. It's revealed that Seminar's president, 
                        Rio, orchestrated this as part of a plan to embezzle funds for Eridu. Both Rio and Koyuki return in Vol. F to help handle new threats in Eridu.

                            The treasurer of the Millennium Academy Student Council, "Seminar". She is strict about money and often quarrels with other club activities from her standpoint. 
                            A prominent mathematical genius even amongst Millennium's STEM-rich student base, she supervises the budget management of the Millennium. She is good at the 
                            abacus and has a habit of counting it to compose herself when faced with complex and troubling matters.

                            Noa is the secretary of the student council "Seminar" at Millennium Science School. She has a very good memory and can memorize almost everything she 
                            sees or hears once, including decisions made at the "Seminar" and records of the contents of meetings.

                            Koyuki is a troublemaker who has returned to Millennium's student council Seminar. She has a natural talent for deciphering mathematical codes, but she seems to be completely 
                            unaware of it.  A prodigious cryptanalyst who can crack even the toughest digital encryption systems through nothing more than her intuition. Due to the frequency of 
                            her encounters with C&C and her general harmlessness, Koyuki is somewhat on friendly terms with C&C and even calls the members of C&C "Senpai." Her nickname is "White Rabbit."
